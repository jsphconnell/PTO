Other than the *choice* of solver and generator already mentioned, the main hyperparameters are the search *effort*, which sets the budget of fitness evaluations indirectly (suitable for a hands-off approach to solving problems), and the *budget* itself, which sets it directly (suitable for experimental comparison with non-PTO methods). Below, we demonstrate their use with a hill-climbing solver (HC), a Microbial Genetic Algorithm solver (MGA), an Evolutionary Algorithm solver (EA) and a random search solver (RS). A larger value for *budget*, or for *effort*, gets a better result."

    "\n",
    "We have seen how simple it is to approach a simple problem: `from PTO import solve, random`, write a solution generator `randsol()` which calls `random` functions, write a fitness function `fitness(x)`, and call `solve(randsol, fitness)`. We have then seen how to use `solve` to optimise the problem with no further user work required. We have also seen methods for controlling the amount of search effort. In later examples, we'll see how to approach other problem types, and some machinery for experimental analysis."
